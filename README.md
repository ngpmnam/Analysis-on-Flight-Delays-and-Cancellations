# Analysis of Flight Delays and Cancellations (Guided by DataCamp)
In this project, I will attempt to conduct a brief exploratory analysis using the flight dataset provided by DataCamp.

## Data Source
The [original project](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1962) was initially coded on DataCamp, and I have adapted it with additional exploration, documentation, and analysis of objectives, code, findings, and evaluation. This modified approach allows for greater flexibility and freedom in analysis and presentation. The dataset, [flight_weather2022.csv](url), contains flight data that is the focus of this analysis.

## Objectives Summary
- **Analyze** airport routes and airlines with the most cancellations.
- **Identify** airlines with the longest delay departure time.
- **Visualize** statistics to produce appealing, informative visuals that convey airport and airline performance.
- **Evaluate** findings to **ask** the right questions, **pinpoint** key trends, and **highlight** obscure ongoing events.


## Key Components
- **Manipulate data** using the **pandas** library in **Python**.
- **Data visualization** with **Matplotlib** to clearly present findings.
